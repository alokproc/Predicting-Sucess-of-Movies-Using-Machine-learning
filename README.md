# Predicting-Sucess-of-Movies-Using-Machine-learning


SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT
BUSINESS CONTEXT
Can you predict if my movie will make money? Will it enter the 200 Cr club?
Every director, producer, production house executive, actor and many others concerned would go
through sleepless nights before the movie launch; right from pre-production to trailer release to
sales numbers coming in. The first weekend of launch is perhaps the most gut crunching time.
Imagine if we could put them at ease by giving them an early indicator of box office success?
The objective of this project is to develop an analytical framework and the associated algorithm to
predict box office success.
INTENDED BUSINESS QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED
The intended key outcomes are as follows:
1. Likelihood of Box office success
I. Analytical algorithm to predict success
2. Provide drivers of box office success. Specifically,
I. What is the lead indicator of success? For example â€“ is it music likeability, director
ratings?
II. What role do super stars play?
3. Insights to help stakeholders create a more effective GTM (go to market) and Intervention
plan to drive $ales and success further
