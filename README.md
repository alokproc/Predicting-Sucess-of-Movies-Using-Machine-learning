# Predicting-Sucess-of-Movies-Using-Machine-learning


SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT
BUSINESS CONTEXT
Can you predict if my movie will make money? Will it enter the 200 Cr club?
Every director, producer, production house executive, actor and many others concerned would go
through sleepless nights before the movie launch; right from pre-production to trailer release to
sales numbers coming in. The first weekend of launch is perhaps the most gut crunching time.
Imagine if we could put them at ease by giving them an early indicator of box office success?
The objective of this project is to develop an analytical framework and the associated algorithm to
predict box office success.
INTENDED BUSINESS QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED
The intended key outcomes are as follows:
1. Likelihood of Box office success
I. Analytical algorithm to predict success
2. Provide drivers of box office success. Specifically,
I. What is the lead indicator of success? For example – is it music likeability, director
ratings?
II. What role do super stars play?
3. Insights to help stakeholders create a more effective GTM (go to market) and Intervention
plan to drive $ales and success further

Key Recommendations
S for Success, S for Super stars
> If you can pay, consider a male super star.
+ And a male super star paired with a female co super star maximizes the chances of
success. Weaving in a strong role for a character star can further bolster the chances of
success.
Story is KING
> If one doesn’t intend to work with super stars, then a stellar story is your best friend.
> Unique themes that are not radically challenging the audience’s thinking but touch their hearts
are likely to do well, even without the support of super stars. Pick up any sleeper hit and this
trend will be visible.
> Strong story complemented with strong character roles and character stars will negate the need
for big budget investments and matinee idols.
> Note:
+ While such movies will turn out to give good returns (ROI), they will not make the 100 Cr
club, though. This is only possible with big stars.
MORE THAN ONE MASTER CHEF CAN SPOIL THE DISH
Pairing of multiple male super stars, unless the roles in the story are very clearly defined, is likely to
not do well. Some of the most unsuccessful movies share this feature.
